# Asteroid Defense
Asteroid Defense is a small [Unity](https://unity.com/) exercise project that simulates an asteroid defense system.

## Assignment
You have to program the defense system of a space station, which consists of a radar and a torpedo launcher. The outer space is full of debris and rocks floating around, but we don't know about them until they show up on the radar. 

Every once in a while, the radar detects some object and it tells us its exact position and velocity at that moment. We immediately have to decide whether the trajectory of the object comes within a given safety distance to the space station, and if it does, shoot a torpedo right away to take it down. 

Assumptions and requirements: 

- The space station has a fixed position. 
- The safety distance is a fixed value. 
- The torpedo launcher can instantly shoot in any direction. 
- Torpedoes have a fixed speed (S) and cannot propel themselves. 
- There is no gravitational force, therefore every object must move at a constant velocity once created. 
- The torpedo launcher logic must contain methods with the following signatures (it's okay to extend the return values to contain more information if necessary): 
  - Return true if the object is bound to cross the safety zone, false otherwise: 
`bool DoesTrajectoryEnterSafetyZone(Vector3 objectPosition, Vector3 objectVelocity);` 
  - Return the velocity needed to hit the target (with the given current position and velocity) considering that torpedoes travel with speed S:
`Vector3 CalculateTorpedoVelocity(Vector3 targetPosition, Vector3 targetVelocity);`
 
Implement a simulation that runs and displays the above scene. Allow the user to spawn debris interactively (preferably being able to control both P and V at will in some manner). 

For bonus points try to signal somehow in advance whether it's possible to shoot down the object before it enters the safety zone.
